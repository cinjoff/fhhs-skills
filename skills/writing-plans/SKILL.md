# Writing Plans

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS — Read Before Anything Else

**You MUST NOT call `EnterPlanMode` or `ExitPlanMode` at any point during this skill.** This skill operates in normal mode and manages its own completion flow via `AskUserQuestion`. Calling `EnterPlanMode` traps the session in plan mode where Write/Edit are restricted. Calling `ExitPlanMode` breaks the workflow and skips the user's execution choice. If you feel the urge to call either, STOP — follow this skill's instructions instead.

## GSD Integration

**Before writing plans, check for GSD project tracking:**

1. Check if `.planning/PROJECT.md` exists
2. **If GSD active:**
   - Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current phase/plan position
   - Read `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase goals, requirements, and success criteria
   - If `.planning/phases/{phase}/{phase}-CONTEXT.md` exists, honor locked decisions — do not contradict them
   - **Save plans to:** `.planning/phases/XX-name/XX-NN-PLAN.md` (next plan number in phase)
   - Include GSD frontmatter: `phase`, `plan`, `requirements` (IDs from ROADMAP)
   - Include `must_haves` in frontmatter (truths, artifacts, key_links) for verification
3. **If no GSD:** Save plans to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

**Prefer composite commands:** If GSD is active, the `/plan` command handles brainstorming, research, discussion, and plan creation with full state management. This skill is the standalone Superpowers alternative.

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

---
```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

<HARD-GATE>
STOP. You are about to complete the plan. DO NOT call EnterPlanMode or ExitPlanMode. You MUST call AskUserQuestion below. Both are FORBIDDEN — EnterPlanMode traps the session, ExitPlanMode skips the user's execution choice.
</HARD-GATE>

Your ONLY permitted next action is calling `AskUserQuestion` with this EXACT structure:

```yaml
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Plan complete and saved to docs/plans/<filename>.md. How would you like to execute it?"
  header: "Execution"
  options:
    - label: "Subagent-Driven (this session)"
      description: "I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration"
    - label: "Parallel Session (separate)"
      description: "Open new session in worktree with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints"
```

**If you are about to call ExitPlanMode, STOP — call AskUserQuestion instead.**

**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use subagent-driven-development
- Stay in this session
- Fresh subagent per task + code review

**If Parallel Session chosen:**
- Guide them to open new session in worktree
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses executing-plans

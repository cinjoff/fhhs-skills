All notable changes to fhhs-skills will be documented in this file.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Tracker v2** — complete rewrite with Preact, JSX components, Tailwind CSS, tiered caching server, and build infrastructure
- **Plan objectives** — extracts and displays objectives from PLAN.md files
- **Sidebar action buttons** — [fix these] on concerns, [update] on codebase, with tooltips
- **Expandable phases** — click to expand/collapse phase details

### Changed
- **Update command** — fetches latest version from GitHub raw instead of marketplace cache
- **Tracker launch** — always refreshes template files from plugin source

### Fixed
- **Grid overflow** — constrain left column with min-w-0
- **7 tracker bugs** — concerns counts, milestone names, buttons, header, body extracts, objectives
- **Tiered caching** — gate state/todos/retros re-parsing, store completion events
- **Plan row layout** — constrain width and align with phase titles

### Removed
- **Recent Activity section** — removed from sidebar

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **Project Tracker redesign** — terminal-aesthetic UI with FHHS design language: JetBrains Mono, CRT scan lines, `//` section headers, text status icons (`✓ ▶ · ~`), fire-red active highlights, and acid-green progress glow
- **Stats bar promoted to hero** — full-width progress bar with completion count as the dominant visual element
- **Empty states** — sidebar sections now show helpful command hints (`/fh:add-todo`, `/fh:quick`) instead of hiding when empty
- **Entrance animations** — staggered fade-in on milestone groups, blinking cursor on active subtask, pulsing connection dot

### Removed
- **Tailwind CSS dependency** — replaced with purpose-built CSS using FHHS color palette

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Project Tracker dashboard** — two-column layout with milestone grouping for better visual organization of project progress

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Project Tracker** — local web dashboard that visualizes GSD project progress with real-time updates via SSE. Launch with `/fh:tracker`
- **`/fh:tracker` skill** — scaffolds `.project-tracker/` into your project (gitignored) and starts the dashboard server
- **`/new-project` integration** — automatically sets up the project tracker during project initialization

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **LSP guidance across code-working skills** — simplify review agents, fix triage/spec review, refactor scope/execute, and extract discover/migrate now include specific LSP operations (`findReferences`, `workspaceSymbol`, `rename`, `documentSymbol`, etc.)
- **Skill frontmatter names** — 16 UI skills still had `ui:` prefix in YAML `name` field after v1.7.0 restructure
- **SPEC.md accuracy** — architecture diagram reflects prefix-free skill dirs; "Playwright" corrected to "agent-browser"

### Changed
- **Eval scenarios expanded** — broader coverage across skills

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Prefix-free command invocation** — workflow skills now invokable without the `fh:` prefix: `/build`, `/fix`, `/verify`, `/quick`, `/refactor`, `/simplify`, `/research`, `/progress`, `/map-codebase`, `/add-todo`, `/check-todos`, `/verify-ui`
- **Design skills lose separate prefix** — 17 impeccable-derived design skills now invoked as `/fh:polish`, `/fh:critique`, `/fh:audit`, `/fh:animate`, `/fh:bolder`, etc. (same `fh:` prefix as all other plugin skills)
- **Setup/maintenance commands keep `fh:` prefix** — `/fh:setup`, `/fh:update`, `/fh:settings`, `/fh:new-project`, `/fh:health`, `/fh:help`, `/fh:revise-claude-md` unchanged
- **`/plan` renamed to `/plan-work`** — avoids conflict with Claude Code's native `/plan` command
- **`/resume` renamed to `/resume-work`** — avoids conflict with Claude Code's native `/resume` command

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Test subagents no longer hang** — all test-running instructions now specify non-watch (CI) mode; vitest uses `--run`, jest uses `CI=true`, preventing subagents from blocking indefinitely in watch mode

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Homebrew auto-install in setup** — `/fh:setup` now checks for Homebrew upfront and installs it if missing before checking other tools
- **GitHub + Vercel automation in new-project** — `/fh:new-project` now creates a private GitHub repo, links a Vercel project, and connects them for auto-deploys — no manual wiring needed

### Fixed
- **Command cross-references use correct prefix** — all commands now suggest `/fh:build`, `/fh:plan`, etc. instead of unprefixed `/build`, `/plan` which could trigger wrong commands
- **Subagent interruption in `/fh:build`** — implementer prompt no longer tells subagents to "ask before starting" (they can't receive answers); subagents now proceed with documented assumptions or return a structured BLOCKED report; orchestrator has explicit recovery protocol for interrupted/blocked agents

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Update indicator** — `/fh:update` now clears the statusline cache after updating, so the `⬆ /fh:update` indicator disappears
- **Setup banner** — summary horse art displays as direct text instead of via Bash, which Claude Code auto-collapses

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **Setup re-linking** — `/fh:setup` now always re-links to the latest cached plugin version instead of short-circuiting when symlinks already exist, fixing "banner script not available" errors after upgrades

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Colored ASCII banner script** — `bin/fhhs-banner.js` outputs the fire horse mark with ANSI colors (red horse, green goggles, yellow fire traces); supports `--summary` mode
- **New horse head ASCII art** — classic style horse profile with wide hacker goggles (`<═◆●◆═>`), diagonal frame arm toward ear, and full head/neck (no longer cut off)

### Fixed
- **CLI tools version check** — no longer falsely reports "broken" (removed nonexistent `--version` flag)
- **Plugin root picks latest version** — sort + tail instead of arbitrary `head -1`; prefers dev checkout over stale cache
- **Variable persistence across steps** — bin + hooks linking runs in a single Bash call
- **LSP plugin check uses node** — replaced `python3` dependency with `node` (guaranteed available)
- **Settings.json update** — uses Read/Edit tools instead of `node -e` to avoid shell escaping issues with `!`

### Changed
- **Setup art** — replaced abstract geometric pyramid with recognizable horse head profile from classic ASCII art

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Fire horse ASCII art banner** — `/setup` opens with the branded fire horse mark (angular head, diamond glasses, fire traces) matching the FHHS visual identity
- **Statusline hook** — `hooks/fhhs-statusline.js` shows model name, current task, context usage bar, and update-available indicator
- **Update check hook** — `hooks/fhhs-check-update.js` checks GitHub for new fhhs-skills versions on SessionStart (background, throttled to 6h)
- **Context monitor hook** — `hooks/fhhs-context-monitor.js` warns the agent when context window is running low (WARNING at 65%, CRITICAL at 75% used)

### Changed
- **`/setup` rewritten with FHHS UI branding** — stage banners, status symbols, checkpoint boxes, error boxes, spawning indicators, and Next Up block. Uses `FHHS ►` prefix instead of `GSD ►`
- **`/setup` installs hooks** — configures `settings.json` with statusline, SessionStart, and PostToolUse hooks; removes old GSD hooks if present
- **README** — added `/reload-plugins` step to install instructions

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **Deduplicated GSD agents** — removed 12 near-duplicate skill copies from `skills/gsd-*/`; agents now live only in `agents/` where they're dispatched via the Agent tool. Saves ~31k tokens per session from skill description overhead
- **Evals updated** — audited all 53 evals against current commands; removed 2 obsolete evals (skills-guide, update-upstream), fixed 3 outdated evals (setup, help, fix-complex). 51 evals remain, all verified passing
- **README** — updated skill/agent counts (17 skills + 15 agents), clarified GSD agent architecture
- **SPEC.md** — directory layout updated to reflect agent/skill separation

### Removed
- `skills/gsd-*/` directories (12 files, ~7,800 lines) — exact duplicates of `agents/gsd-*.md` with only `user-invokable: false` added

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-07

### Changed
- **README** — rewritten with full command reference, skill overview, and setup instructions
- **Maintainer commands** — `/update-upstream` and `/update-gsd` moved out of shipped commands

### Added
- **`/release` command** — maintainer tooling for consistent version bumps, changelog, and GitHub releases
- **Post-push hook** — reminds to release when untagged commits exist on main

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **`/update` command** — uses `marketplace update` (not `refresh`) and refreshes marketplace before installing
- **Hidden internal skills** — GSD and Superpowers skills no longer clutter the user-facing skill list; only composite commands and Impeccable design skills are shown

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **`/simplify` command and skill** — parallel code reuse, quality, and efficiency review. Runs automatically as Step 8b in `/build`, also standalone
- **`/revise-claude-md` command and `claude-md-improver` skill** — audit, evaluate, and improve CLAUDE.md files with GSD-aware context detection
- **Bundled GSD CLI** — `bin/gsd-tools.cjs` ships with the plugin; `/setup` symlinks it, no separate `npm install -g get-shit-done` needed
- **LSP integration** — codebase mapper, systematic debugging, and implementer prompt use LSP (`goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, `incomingCalls`, `hover`) for precise code navigation
- **GSD integration in Superpowers skills** — `writing-plans` and `executing-plans` check for `.planning/PROJECT.md` and route to GSD phase paths automatically
- **EnterPlanMode prohibition** — hard gates in `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, and `using-superpowers` prevent plan mode trapping
- **Cross-platform `/setup`** — detects macOS/Linux/Windows, walks through Homebrew, Node.js, GitHub CLI, Vercel CLI, TypeScript LSP plugin installation
- **Architecture spec** (`SPEC.md`) — documents the full layer model, routing, and design principles
- **Session retros** (`.planning/retros/`) — post-session retrospective notes

### Changed
- **Corrected upstream references** — Superpowers repo is `obra/superpowers` (was `pcvelz`), forked from v4.3.1 (was incorrectly listed as v4.3.4/4.3.5)
- **Upstream snapshots added** — `upstream/superpowers-4.3.1/`, `upstream/feature-dev-55b58ec6/`, `upstream/claude-md-management-1.0.0/`
- **COMPATIBILITY.md** — added feature-dev, claude-md-management, external dependencies table, expanded Superpowers and Impeccable coverage
- **PATCHES.md** — comprehensive rewrite with accurate patch tracking for all upstreams including claude-md-management and feature-dev agents
- **`/update-gsd` simplified** — streamlined from large script to focused update check

### Removed
- **`.tasks.json` persistence** — stripped from `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `brainstorming`. GSD state management replaces it
- **`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` boilerplate** — removed native task tool integration sections from skills (GSD tracking handles this)
- **`upstream/superpowers-4.3.5/`** — stale snapshot replaced by corrected `upstream/superpowers-4.3.1/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Code explorer agent** — reusable agent for tracing code flows and surfacing essential files before design
- **Code architect agent** — reusable agent for designing implementation blueprints with different architectural lenses
- **Confidence scoring in code review** — issues rated 0-100, only high-signal issues (>=75) reported
- **Deep exploration in brainstorming** — optional parallel explorer/architect agents for complex features
- **`/update` command** — check for updates and install without digging through plugin menus
- **Version tracking** — CHANGELOG.md and git tags for release management

### Fixed
- User-facing routing now recommends composite commands (`/plan`, `/build`, `/verify`) instead of raw GSD commands (`/gsd:plan-phase`, `/gsd:execute-phase`, `/gsd:verify-work`)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Visual verification with Playwright (`/verify-ui`) using agent-browser with fallback

### Changed

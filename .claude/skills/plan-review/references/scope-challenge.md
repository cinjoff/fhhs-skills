# Step 0: Nuclear Scope Challenge + Mode Selection

## 0A. Premise Challenge
1. Is this the right problem to solve? Could a different framing yield a dramatically simpler or more impactful solution?
2. What is the actual user/business outcome? Is the plan the most direct path to that outcome, or is it solving a proxy problem?
3. What would happen if we did nothing? Real pain point or hypothetical one?

## 0B. Challenge against must_haves
If the plan has a `must_haves` section (produced by `/fh:plan-work`), challenge its truths:
* Are the truths actually observable and user-facing, or are they implementation details masquerading as outcomes?
* Is each truth necessary? Would the feature still succeed without any of them?
* Are any truths missing — outcomes the user cares about that the plan forgot to state?
* Do the artifacts and key_links fully cover the truths, or are there gaps?

## 0C. Existing Code Leverage
1. What existing code already partially or fully solves each sub-problem? Map every sub-problem to existing code. Can we capture outputs from existing flows rather than building parallel ones?
2. Is this plan rebuilding anything that already exists? If yes, explain why rebuilding is better than refactoring.

## 0D. Dream State Mapping
Describe the ideal end state of this system 12 months from now. Does this plan move toward that state or away from it?
```
  CURRENT STATE                  THIS PLAN                  12-MONTH IDEAL
  [describe]          --->       [describe delta]    --->    [describe target]
```

## 0E. Mode-Specific Analysis

Run mode analysis per @references/review-modes.md for selected mode

## 0F. Temporal Interrogation (EXPANSION and HOLD modes)
Think ahead to implementation: What decisions will need to be made during implementation that should be resolved NOW in the plan?
```
  HOUR 1 (foundations):     What does the implementer need to know?
  HOUR 2-3 (core logic):   What ambiguities will they hit?
  HOUR 4-5 (integration):  What will surprise them?
  HOUR 6+ (polish/tests):  What will they wish they'd planned for?
```
Surface these as questions for the user NOW, not as "figure it out later."

## 0G. Mode Selection
Present three options:
1. **SCOPE EXPANSION:** The plan is good but could be great. Propose the ambitious version, then review that. Push scope up. Build the cathedral.
2. **HOLD SCOPE:** The plan's scope is right. Review it with maximum rigor — architecture, security, edge cases. Make it bulletproof.
3. **SCOPE REDUCTION:** The plan is overbuilt or wrong-headed. Propose a minimal version that achieves the core goal, then review that.

Context-dependent defaults:
* Greenfield feature → default EXPANSION
* Bug fix or hotfix → default HOLD SCOPE
* Refactor → default HOLD SCOPE
* Plan touching >15 files → suggest REDUCTION unless user pushes back
* User says "go big" / "ambitious" / "cathedral" → EXPANSION, no question

Once selected, commit fully. Do not silently drift.

**STOP.** AskUserQuestion once per issue. Do NOT batch. Recommend + WHY. If no issues or fix is obvious, state what you'll do and move on — don't waste a question. Do NOT proceed until user responds.
